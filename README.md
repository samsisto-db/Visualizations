# Visualizations Repository

This repository contains various public data sets and corresponding exploratory descriptive statistics and visualizations put together in Python.

## MovieData Folder
This folder contains MovieLens data sets which were collected by the GroupLens Research Project at the University of Minnesota. There is a Python Jupyter notebook titled MovieDataVisualizations.ipynb that contains the investigative code.

This code contains an initial investigation into the users, ratings and movie information data sets and looks at descriptive statistics and visualizations to examine what is happening with this data. Please take a look at the code and comments in the notebook to see what I was investigating!
